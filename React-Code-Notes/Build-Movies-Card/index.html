<!-- 
Q. EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF INDEX.HTML FILE IN REACT APP? OR IN REACT HOW MANY HTML FILES 
   ARE NEEDED ? OR WHAT IS SPAs (SINGLE PAGE APPLIATIONS) ? ***
  - The whole React app is mounted to a single HTML element, usually <div id="root">, 
    which serves as the container in the DOM. 
  - React is used to build SPAs (Single Page Applcations), which dynamically update 
    content without requiring full-page reloads. The index.html file does not change 
    during navigation; all updates are handled by React.
