/* An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: 
those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. */

x = 7;   // The expression itself has a side effect of changing the value of x.

/* Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. 
Operands can be variables, values, or expressions. 
There are various types of operators in JavaScript:
1. Assignment operators 
2. Comparison operators
3. Logical operators  
4. Conditional (ternary) operator  
5. Arithmetic operators
6. BigInt operators
7. String operators
8. Bitwise operators

/* The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression 
Here is a brief overview of the precedence of some common operators in JavaScript (from highest to lowest):

1. Member Access:
. (dot notation)
[] (bracket notation)

2. Function Call:
() (function invocation)

3. Postfix/Unary Operators:
expr++, expr-- (postfix increment/decrement)
++expr, --expr (prefix increment/decrement)
+expr, -expr, ~expr, !expr (unary plus, minus, bitwise NOT, logical NOT)

4. Multiplicative Operators:
*, /, % (multiplication, division, modulus)

5. Additive Operators:
+, - (addition, subtraction)

6. Relational Operators:
<, >, <=, >= (less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to)
instanceof, in

7 . Equality Operators:
==, !=, ===, !==

8. Logical AND:
&&
 
9. Logical OR:
||

10. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
? :

11. Assignment Operators:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (and others)

/*Associativity determines the direction in which operators with the same precedence are
evaluatedâ€”whether they are evaluated from left to right or right to left. 
Left-to-Right Associativity:
Most operators, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), and assignment (=), are left-to-right associative.

Right-to-Left Associativity:
The exponentiation operator (**) is an example of a right-to-left associative operator.
*/ 









// ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
 
 // Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable
 let x = 10;
 x += 5;
 console.log(x);
// Similalry -=, *=, /=, %=(Remainder Assignment) 
// Exponentiation Assignment Operator(**=) raises a variable to the power of the operand. 
 let y = 9;
 y **= 5;
 console.log(y);   // (9^5)
// doubt in bitwise hence in bitwise assignment operators. 














// COMPARISON OPERATORS 

/* Comparison Operators used to compare values and return a Boolean result. 
Mostly used in conditional statements*/
 // Loose Equality checks only vlaue with type conversion 
 console.log( 5 == '5'); // Outputs true and type conversion occurs 
 // Strict Equality checks both value and the type without type conversion 
 console.log( 10 === '10'); // Returns false 
 // Loose Inequality checks if two values are not equal after type coercion.
 console.log(5 != '5'); // Output: false
 // Strict Equality checks if two values are not equal without type coercion. 
 console.log(5 !== '5'); // Output: true

 /* Also we have Greater Than (>), Less Than (<), Greater Than or Equal To (>=), 
 Less Than or Equal To (<=)  */ 











 /*  LOGICAL OPERATOR 
Logical operators determines the logic between variables or values (logical operations)
Logical AND && - TRUE if both operands are THRUE.  
Logical OR || - TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE.
Logical NOT ~ or ! - NEGATES the boolean value of operand. 
*/
console.log(50>100 && 30>15 && 40>30);
// returns false as one of them is false 
// similary 
console.log (10>60 || 30>2);

// Note && will return first fasly value or the last truthy value 
let a;
a = 10 && 20;

a = 10 && 20 && 30; 
console.log(a);
a = 10 && 0 && 30; 
console.log(a);
a = 10 && '' && 0 && 30; 
console.log(a);
// example of && use 
const posts = [];
console.log(posts[0]);  // we would not like to display undefined 
// so we do this 
const post = [];
post.length > 0 && console.log(post[0]);

// Also note that || will return the first truthy value or the last value 
let b;
b = 10 || 20;

console.log(b);
b = 0 || null || '' || undefined;

 // that works like ||, but it only returns the second expression, 
// when the first one is "nullish", i.e. null or undefined. 
let c;

console.log(c);
c = null ?? 20;

// LOGICAL ASSIGNMENT 
 // ||=  assigns the right side value only if left is fasly value 
 let v = false;

 if (!v) {
   v = 10;
 }
console.log(v);
 
// short cut way 
 let v2 = false;
 v2 = v2 || 10;
 console.log(v2);

 // more shorter way using logical assignment 
 let a2 = null;
 a2 ||= 10
 console.log(a2);

// Similarly we have ??= assigns right side value only if the left is null or undefined
let f = undefined;
f ??= 30;
console.log(f);
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
/* Conditional (Ternary) Operator ssigns a value to a variable based on some condition.
 variablename = (condition) ? value1ifConTrue:value2ifConFalse
 Conditional operator is a concise way to write a simple if-else statement in JavaScript. 
 It is often used for short, one-line conditional expressions. */
 
 
 
 
 // using ternary operator 
 let age = 15;
 let message = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough";
 console.log(message);

 // or more shorter 
 let age2 = 19;
 (age2 < 18) ? console.log('You cannot have sex') : console.log('You can have sex')

 // for example we something like this 
 const auth = true;
 let redirect;
 
 if (auth) {
  console.log('Welcome to Dashboard');
  redirect ='/dashboard';
 } else {
  console.log('Access Denied');
  redirect = '/login';

 // % Modulus operator returns the remainder of divison 
 // The increment operator (++) increments numbers.

// The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
