/* The main objective of node js is to use javascript for both back and front end. 
Used more in small or startup companies. Node works on single thread (Refer threading concept) so its 
not good for CPU intense tasks like long running calculations like that. So any project that is 
not inteded to be CPU intense node is petty good option. Like I/O operations making request to 
the server, sending data to the server getting response etc. 
Node is great for REST APIs and Microservices.
Building back-end API with node by serving JSON, doing all database interactions with nodejs.
Node with mongo makes good combo.
Node can be great for real time services like chat, live updates.
   CRUD apps like blogs,shoping carts etc.   */
