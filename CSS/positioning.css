Postioning specifies type of postion method for an element. 
It is a layout technique used to control the placement of elements on a web page. 
After specifying the postion type the top, left, buttom and right
properties are used to adjust the postioning. 
Q. HOW MANY TYPES OF POSTIONS PROPERTIES ARE THERE ? EXPLAIN ABSOLUTE AND 
   RELATIVE POSTIONS. EXPLAIN FIXED POSTION.
