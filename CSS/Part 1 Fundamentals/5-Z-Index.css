Q. EXPLAIN WHAT IS Z-INDEX IN CSS ?
   The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element 
   (which element should be placed in front of, or behind the others).
   Note that, 
   z-index only works on positioned elements as positioned elememts can sometimes
   overlap. It also works for flex items 
   An element can have a positive or negative stack order

/*
In above styles all the 3 children of the parent div overlaps and without
z index only children 3 that is last one will appear. We can play around by 
adjusting z index values within children to keep the desired children in front. 
Note- An element with greater stack order is always above an element with 
a lower stack order
